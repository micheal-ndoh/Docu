# Issue #2: Change Email Notifications to In-App Signing

## 📧 Current Behavior (The Problem)

### What Happens Now:
1. **User creates a submission** via the "Create Submission" dialog
2. **Checkbox is checked by default**: "Send email invitation" (line 476 in submissions/page.tsx)
3. **`send_email: true`** is sent to DocuSeal API (line 74, 145)
4. **DocuSeal sends an email** to the submitter with a signing link
5. **Submitter receives email** → clicks link → signs document externally
6. **User never uses the in-app signing page** at `/submissions/[id]/sign`

### The Issue:
- Users are being sent **emails** to sign documents
- The app already has a **built-in signing page** (`/submissions/[id]/sign/page.tsx`)
- The in-app signing experience is **ignored**
- This creates a **disconnected user experience** - users leave the app to sign

---

## ✅ Desired Behavior (The Solution)

### What Should Happen:
1. **User creates a submission** via the dialog
2. **NO email is sent** (`send_email: false`)
3. **User is redirected** to the in-app signing page immediately
4. **Submitter signs within the app** using the embedded DocuSeal form
5. **Seamless experience** - everything happens in your application

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Better UX** - Users stay within your app
- ✅ **Faster signing** - No need to check email
- ✅ **More control** - You control the signing experience
- ✅ **White-label ready** - Users don't see DocuSeal branding in emails
- ✅ **Immediate action** - Sign right after creating submission

---

## 🔧 Implementation Plan

### Changes Required:

#### **1. Update Form Default** (`submissions/page.tsx`)
**Current:**
```typescript
defaultValues: {
  submitters: [{ email: '', name: '', role: '' }],
  send_email: true,  // ❌ Sends email
}
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
defaultValues: {
  submitters: [{ email: '', name: '', role: '' }],
  send_email: false,  // ✅ No email sent
}
```

#### **2. Remove/Hide Email Checkbox** (Optional)
**Current:**
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
  <input
    id="send_email"
    type="checkbox"
    {...register('send_email')}
    defaultChecked  // ❌ Checked by default
  />
  <Label htmlFor="send_email">Send email invitation</Label>
</div>
```

**Option A - Remove completely:**
```tsx
{/* Email checkbox removed - always use in-app signing */}
```

**Option B - Keep but unchecked:**
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
  <input
    id="send_email"
    type="checkbox"
    {...register('send_email')}
    // defaultChecked removed - unchecked by default
  />
  <Label htmlFor="send_email">Send email invitation (optional)</Label>
</div>
```

#### **3. Redirect to Signing Page After Creation**
**Current:**
```typescript
const responseData = await response.json();
console.log('Response data:', responseData);

toast.success('Submission created successfully!');
reset();
await fetchSubmissions();  // ❌ Just refreshes list
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
const responseData = await response.json();
console.log('Response data:', responseData);

// Extract submission ID from response
const submissionId = Array.isArray(responseData) 
  ? responseData[0]?.submission_id 
  : responseData.submission_id;

if (submissionId) {
  toast.success('Submission created! Redirecting to signing page...');
  // Redirect to in-app signing page
  router.push(`/submissions/${submissionId}/sign`);
} else {
  toast.success('Submission created successfully!');
  reset();
  await fetchSubmissions();
}
```

#### **4. Update Success Message**
Show a clear message that guides users to sign:
```typescript
toast.success('Submission created! You can now sign the document.', {
  description: 'Redirecting to signing page...',
  duration: 2000,
});
```

## 📊 User Flow Comparison

### BEFORE (Current - Email-based):
```
User creates submission
    ↓
Email sent to submitter
    ↓
User waits for email
    ↓
Opens email client
    ↓
Clicks link in email
    ↓
Signs on DocuSeal website
    ↓
Returns to app (maybe)
```

### AFTER (Proposed - In-app):
```
User creates submission
    ↓
Immediately redirected to signing page
    ↓
Signs within the app (iframe)
    ↓
Submission marked complete
    ↓
User stays in the app
```

## 🎯 Technical Details

### How In-App Signing Works:

1. **DocuSeal API Response** includes `embed_src`:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "submission_id": 123,
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "embed_src": "https://docuseal.com/s/pAMimKcyrLjqVt",
  "status": "sent"
}
```

2. **Signing Page** (`/submissions/[id]/sign/page.tsx`):
   - Fetches submission details
   - Extracts `embed_src` from first submitter
   - Embeds DocuSeal form in an iframe
   - User signs directly in the app

3. **No Email Needed**:
   - When `send_email: false`, DocuSeal creates the submission but doesn't send emails
   - The `embed_src` link is still generated
   - You can use it immediately for in-app signing

---

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Change Default Behavior
- Set `send_email: false` in form defaults
- Remove or uncheck the email checkbox

### Step 2: Add Redirect Logic
- After successful submission creation
- Extract submission ID from API response
- Navigate to `/submissions/{id}/sign`

### Step 3: Improve UX
- Add loading state during redirect
- Show clear success message
- Handle edge cases (no submission ID, etc.)

### Step 4: Optional Enhancements
- Add a "Sign Later" button option
- Show signing status on submissions list
- Add reminder notifications for unsigned submissions

---

## 🔍 Edge Cases to Handle

### 1. Multiple Submitters
**Current:** Only first submitter's `embed_src` is used
**Solution:** 
- Show list of submitters
- Allow selecting which one to sign as
- Or redirect to first pending submitter

### 2. Already Signed
**Current:** Signing page shows iframe even if completed
**Solution:**
- Check submission status first
- Show "Already signed" message if completed
- Redirect to view completed document

### 3. No Signing Link
**Current:** Shows error message
**Solution:**
- Provide fallback options
- Allow resending invitation
- Show contact support message

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After implementation, test:

- [ ] Create submission → No email sent
- [ ] Automatically redirected to signing page
- [ ] Signing form loads correctly in iframe
- [ ] Can complete signature
- [ ] Submission status updates to "completed"
- [ ] Can navigate back to submissions list
- [ ] Multiple submitters handled correctly
- [ ] Already-signed submissions show appropriate message

---

## 💡 Additional Considerations

### Email as Optional Feature:
Instead of removing email completely, you could:
- Keep it as an **advanced option**
- Default to in-app signing
- Allow users to **also** send email if needed
- Use case: When submitter is a different person

### Notification System:
For submissions where the submitter is not the creator:
- Send in-app notification instead of email
- Share signing link via the app
- Add "Share Link" button to copy signing URL

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Goal:** Move from email-based signing to in-app signing

**Key Changes:**
1. Set `send_email: false` by default
2. Redirect to `/submissions/[id]/sign` after creation
3. Remove or hide email checkbox
4. Improve signing page UX

**Impact:**
- Better user experience
- Faster signing process
